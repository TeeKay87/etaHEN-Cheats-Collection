## How to use
FTP into your PlayStation 5 and delete, rename or backup the following:
  - `/data/etaHEN/cheats/json/`
  - `/data/etaHEN/cheats/mc4/`
  - `/data/etaHEN/cheats/shn/`
  - `/data/etaHEN/cheats/json.txt`
  - `/data/etaHEN/cheats/mc4.txt`
  - `/data/etaHEN/cheats/shn.txt`

Place all files and folders from my collection in `/data/etaHEN/cheats/`.

`IMPORTANT!` Restart and re-jb the PlayStation. Enjoy your brand new cheats.

## Find compatible cheats
Open https://github.com/TeeKay87/etaHEN-Cheats-Collection/blob/master/CheatsList.txt and `CTRL+F` search for either an `ID` or `game title` to find what version of the game has a compatible cheat file.

## Version History
### 2026-02-05
`[ADD]`	PPSA02525	01.009.000	Tormented Souls

Collection created with new version of my etaHEN Cheats Manager.

Added `Yharnam` cheats.

As etaHEN only can use one cheat of each file format at a time, this version of eHEN-CM defaults to only keep the largest file by file size as that file is more likely to contain the largest amount of cheats.

Some of the official cheats, and cheats from other sources, are missing tags in their json and xml formatting, and some have other issues. eHEN-CM now tries to repair these broken files to hopefully make more cheats work as intended.

Naming of files and parsing of version numbers has been improved.

eHEN-CM now produces a changelog.txt which contains logs of all `added`, `updated` and `removed` cheats to help produce future notes about changes.

As of now, my collection has cheats for `2321` games and updates, whereas the etaHEN Cheats repository has cheats for `2130`.
### 2026-01-31
Added the first iteration of the collection containing cheats for 2284 different games and versions
